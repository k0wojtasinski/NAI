# Neural Networks for classification - implemented in Keras and Tensorflow

### Goal
Goal of this project is to show how to implement simple neural networks for 4 datasets (Fashion MNIST, Iris, Cifar10, IMDB)
I implemented simple API to simplify creation of Neural Networks

### How to run it
In order to run this I recommend using Google Colab environment: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DgSAzMJxn_WRYPcIAOqt69I7bVysq1ls?usp=sharing
It uses code provided in models.py file to show how these networks perform.
It also compares accuracy with Iris dataset from the previous environment.
I exported this notebook as Exercise6.ipynb, but it is not preferred way to run it locally.
